            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>In a mixing bowl whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt, set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <li>In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment cream together butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar until combined.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Mix in egg. Add in red food coloring, vanilla and vinegar.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add flour mixture and mix just until combined.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Mix in 3/4 cup white or semi-sweet chocolate chips (set aside remaining 1/3 cup to use after baking).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cover bowl and chill dough 1–2 hours until dough is nearly firm. Near the end of chilling preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Scoop dough out and shape into balls about 1 1/2 Tbsp each (or 28g). Transfer to parchment paper lined baking sheet spacing 2-inches apart.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bake one sheet at a time (keep remaining dough chilled and repeat process), until cookies appear set on the edges but slightly under-baked in the center, about 10–11 minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Remove cookies from oven and gently press some of the remaining white chocolate chips into tops.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Let cool on baking sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool.</li>          
            </ol>
